new smaller version, same damn place at 81k instead of bloaty 500.

i use single-channel echo in a lot of my songs, but it\'s a pain to write it in MCK.  i don\'t have PPMCK and i don\'t really want to use it, so i wrote my own program to convert plain notes into single channel echo-ized notes.

usage:

autoecho <filename>

the program will look for my made-up EKO macro in the file you type in after its name. here\'s how it works.

EKO <length1> <length2> <vol1> <vol2> <notes> EKOF
where length1 and vol1 correspond to the main notes, and length2 and vol2 correspond to the echo values.

for example:

EKO 16 16 8 4 a b>c d e EKOF 

would be converted to

v8 a16 v4 a16 v8 b16 v4 a16 v8 >c16 v4 <b16 v8 >d16 v4 c16 v8 e16 v4 d16

you can obviously change up the four variables at the beginning.  instead of 16 and 16, 12 and 24 would work for length1 and length2 respectively for a shorter echo and longer note hold time (dotted notes don\'t work, so using their substitutes like this is the only option for now).

issues:
1. EKOF can\'t be the last thing in the file.  you can put a space at the end of this to fix it (or more MML code, etc).
2. don\'t put comments between EKO and EKOF AND don\'t mention EKO or EKOF in comments as this program doesn\'t yet distinguish between comments and code
3. for that matter, don\'t put anything but notes or > or < between EKO and EKOF thanks to the same reason as above 

you can get it from http://4x86.com/autoecho.exe .  i hope this helps a few of you out!

oh and as for integration into MuMML, here are some steps:

1. go to the configuration
2. click on BAT script at the top
3. after CD $progpath$ go to the next line and add \"autoecho $temp$\" (minus quotes)
4. save autoecho.exe to your /prog/mck folder (same folder as mckc.exe)

this should work (it does for me).  post here if you have any issues, and please report any additional bugs!
