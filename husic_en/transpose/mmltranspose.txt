This program is a simple one that just transposes a group of notes X half steps up or down.

usage: mmltranspose <filename>

in your code, use TR(num) and TROF to denote where to start and stop transposing.
Code:

A TR1 a b> c d e TROF


becomes
Code:

A b- > c c+ d+ f


also multiline stuff is fine.
Code:

A TR3 a b c d e f g
A > c d e f e
B a c a b a c d c
C c>c<cc>cdedc<c TROF


the above code would work well.

two things to remember!

1.  if you use this with AutoEcho, make sure you use it after using autoecho.  AutoEcho cannot deal with the code output generated by this program correctly.

2.  remember that transposing the noise and DPCM channels will screw with samples and sounds you might want, so it is recommended that you stick to transposing the squares and triangle.. technically DPCM and noise still work though.
