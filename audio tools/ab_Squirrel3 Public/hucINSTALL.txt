========================================
THIS INSTALLATION GUIDE IS FOR WINDOWS
========================================
----------------------------------------
You need to have HuC installed in order to use Squirrel.  The MAKE.bat file in the Squirrel
directory will automagically call HuC for you.  Once it is installed, you should be able to use
Squirrel no problem.


[Step 1]: Download HuC from zeograd.com

http://www.zeograd.com/download_presentation.php?lang=en&id=310

[Step 2]: unzip this file and place it somewhere where you do not intend to move it.

I suggest you place it directly on your C drive at C:\

[Step 3]:  if you want, rename the folder you have unzipped to something short and easy.  I suggest
"HuC" (without quotes).


Either way, you now need to edit your PATH and define a user variable in Windows.

---------
Under XP:
---------
-Right click my computer and select properties.
-press advanced tab
-press environment variables button
-Under system variables section press NEW
     - Set name to PCE_INCLUDE
	- Set value to C:\huc\include\pce  where huc is whatever you named your folder to
	  NOTE: If you did not place it directly on C:\, you will need to fix this directory to match
	  wherever it is you put the directory!
-Again, Under system variables
     -Find the PATH variable in the box and highlight it.
	-Press EDIT.
	-append this to the end of value field: ;C:\huc\bin
	   NOTE you need a semicolon as shown.  Semicolons separate each directory.
	   
-Hit OK until all windows close.


-----------------
Under Vista/Win7:
-----------------
-Right click computer and select properties.
-press advanced system settings button on the left
-press environment variables button
-Under system variables section press NEW
     - Set name to PCE_INCLUDE
	- Set value to C:\huc\include\pce  where huc is whatever you named your folder to
	  NOTE: If you did not place it directly on C:\, you will need to fix this directory to match
	  wherever it is you put the directory!
-Again, Under system variables
     -Find the PATH variable in the box and highlight it.
	-Press EDIT.
	-append this to the end of value field: ;C:\huc\bin
	   NOTE you need a semicolon as shown.  Semicolons separate each directory.
	   
-Hit OK until all windows close.
--------
TEST IT!
--------

Open a new command prompt (Start--->Run--->CMD)

type HuC and press enter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You should get this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HuC (v3.21, 2005/04/09, Denki release)

USAGE: c:/huc/bin/huc.exe [-options] infile

Options to compile step:
-s/-S       : create asm output only (do not invoke assembler)
-t/-T       : include text of 'C' in asm output/listings
-Dsym[=val] : define symbol 'sym' when compiling
-O[val]     : invoke optimization (level <value>)
-cd/-scd    : create CDROM output
-over(lay)  : create CDROM overlay section

Options to assembler step:
-Asym[=val] : define symbol 'sym' to assembler
-v/-V       : verbose - maximum information in output files
